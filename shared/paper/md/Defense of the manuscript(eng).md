Good morning, teachers and students.

I am yuran, Grade 18, Mathematics Department, and my thesis title is

Research on credit decision-making model and algorithm of micro, small and medium enterprises

-

I will start with the decision foreword, the decision interest rate, the decision amount, and the decision summary

Explain in four aspects

-

The first part is the introduction to the decision of the paper

-

In recent years, small and medium-sized enterprises have

Small scale, lack of huge mortgage and flexible characteristics

So is the system of bank credit

The late start and lack of a complete credit decision-making system, the need for investment to obtain revenue, etc.

This paper serves that purpose

-

As shown above is the status of research at home and abroad,

The application effect of logistics regression and support vector machine model prediction is remarkable

-

The second part is the annual interest rate selection for the paper decision

-

In this section, we introduced a variable called melting entropy,

It represents the income expectation of the bank generated by the unchurned enterprise and the annual interest rate

This is necessary, let the enterprise and the bank two-way choice, by changing the annual interest rate to increase the bank's income,

It also dynamically balances the size of the enterprise, gives higher quotas and raises the annual interest rate,

It is also sufficient to increase the bank's economic efficiency while increasing the amount and annual interest rate

At the same time, the bank can adjust the market dynamically according to the loss of enterprises and improve the flexibility

Then the annual interest rate is selected in four steps based on melting entropy,

They are polar, reverse, subpolar, amortized, respectively

The fused entropy simulation data is shown on the right,

The first step is to take the pole, as the name suggests, to choose the highest melting entropy to give the maximum profit to the bank

The second part of the reverse order, that is, after taking the pole, there is a choice space left and right of the extreme value, and the reverse order will choose the forward,

The reason is that it is not desirable to increase the annual interest rate to reduce the entropy gain and increase the loan risk

The third subpolar step, that is, after the reverse order, selects the secondary extreme value of the left region inferior to the extreme value,

Looping through the second and third steps leads to a variety of decreasing schemes,

The fourth step, amortization, is the integration of all the previously selected solutions,

For those enterprises with relatively good operating conditions, the scheme of relatively high annual interest rate is selected.

In this way, the bank's profit expectation and the loan repayment risk of the enterprise can be amortized

-

The third part is the calculation of the decision amount

-

First apply statistics to the enterprise

Asset conversion rate, rebate rate, net profit proportion, blue ticket rate

These four factors are substituted into the logistics regression

Asset conversion ratio is the ratio of the output and input amount of the enterprise

It reflects the ability of the enterprise's own assets transformation

The rebate rate is the proportion of negative items in the enterprise

It reflects the error rate of the enterprise decision-making level

The proportion of net profit is the proportion of the difference between the enterprise and all enterprises

It reflects the competitiveness of enterprises in the current environment

Blue invoice rate is the proportion of the accuracy of the enterprise invoices

It reflects the error rate of the enterprise management layer

The above four factors can reflect the operating status of the enterprise.

The credit factor can be obtained by adjusting the logistics regression calculation

-

Then using the credit factor and credit rating of the blueprint enterprise,

And the credit factor of the enterprise applying for credit is transferred into the SVM model

The SVM model can be seen in the image on the right

x represents the training set and y represents the number of training groups and z represents the mean absolute error

The extreme point of the mean absolute error is selected

After normalization calculation, the reputation prediction of each enterprise can be obtained

-

In addition, considering the unexpected factors, the enterprises were divided into three categories,

Are positive correlation, irrelevant correlation and negative correlation,

To ensure the bank's operating income and stability, the algorithm will make corresponding adjustments,

Take the enterprise with credit rating A in this table as an example,

Given different shares, these parameters can be adjusted to some extent by the algorithm user

For example, if the asset conversion rate is greater than the average,

Enterprises positively related to the unexpected factor are given a share coefficient of 10

Similarly, B-level and C-level rating enterprises also have corresponding parameter adjustment

Dividing the bank's planned loan quota after giving the share coefficient,

The loan share can be calculated to specific enterprises

Finally, after the selection of annual interest rate for melting entropy in Section 2,

Can concretize to each enterprise's own credit lending decision

-

Section IV will be a summary of bank credit decisions

-

The first part of the melting entropy balances the risk and return of the bank

The appropriate annual interest rate is selected for the enterprise

The second part of logistics regression summarizes the corporate credit factor,

The multi-dimensional data is summarized and reduced to reduce the amount of calculation

In the third part, the support vector machine brings in the data of the blueprint enterprise and the forecast enterprise.

The credit prediction of the credit enterprise under the lowest error is selected, and the error is small

The fourth part takes into account the unexpected factors for different situations of the enterprise

The share of loans has been adjusted accordingly

In general, the idea of giving credit to banks,

Reasonable decision was made on loan amount and annual interest rate for enterprises in different situations

That's all for my graduation thesis,

Thank you all teachers, please criticize and correct
