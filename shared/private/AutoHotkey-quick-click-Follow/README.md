#Fast Follow from AutoHotkey

I set up by an "Alt" + "1" activation click "Follow" at a time.

You need to download AutoHotkey to use this script.

Of course, you need to modify this sentence before using it:

__ImageFilePath:="[Fill in the folder path here]\Follow.png"

Then, you double-click the activation with AutoHotkey open this script

Note: after optimized set of detection area is x: 1400 to 1600, y:, 0 to 1000, pressing it once will do it ten times

In addition, this is a fun script, the consequences of their own
